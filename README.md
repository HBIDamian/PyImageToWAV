# PyImageToWav
This is a python script that converts an image to a sound wave. The script reads an image and converts it to a sound wave by reading the pixel values of the image and converting them to sound wave frequencies.

## Files
- `imageToWav.py`: The main script that converts an image to a sound wave.
- `audioToImage.py`: The script that converts a sound wave to an image used for testing purposes.

## Requirements
- Python 3 (See the scripts for the required libraries)
- ffmpeg (For converting the audio file to a image, used in `audioToImage.py`) It isn't required for the main script.

- [How NOT to Sample Audio - Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQOdmckqNro),  Explained by [David Domminney Fowler](https://www.youtube.com/@domminney). This script is essentially a python port of the code in the video. I highly recommend watching the video to understand how the script works, and the theory behind it, as well as just giving the channel a watch in general, it's great!
